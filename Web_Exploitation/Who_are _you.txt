Description
Let me in. Let me iiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn http://mercury.picoctf.net:39114/

Solve: 
First I see the message "Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!"
I think about using Burpsuit to modify the request 
I use Proxy on Burpsuit with their browser (my intercept button is on). Then I send get request to repeater 
I change the User-Agent: PicoBrowser 
-> then I send, and get the next message: "I don't trust users visiting from another site"
Then I add extra header, Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:39114 
-> another message: "Sorry, this site only worked in 2018."
I think about date:
Then I add Date:2018
-> another message: "I don't trust users who can be tracked."
Then I add Do Not Track, DNT:1 
-> another message: "This website is only for people from Sweden."
I think to get ip from Sweden, and I add X-Forwarded-For: 2.255.255.138 [using this website to know the Sweden ip: https://tools.tracemyip.org/search--country/sweden ]
-> another message: "You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?"
I think about language, then I add Accept-Language: sv-SWE 

GET / HTTP/1.1
