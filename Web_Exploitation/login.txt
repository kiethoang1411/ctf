Description
My dog-sitter's brother made this website but I can't get in; can you help?
login.mars.picoctf.net

Solve: 
I view page source and notice index.js 
I see this string "cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ" look like encoded in base64 then
I try to convert it to ASCII -> and get the flag
