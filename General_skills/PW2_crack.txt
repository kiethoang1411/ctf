Description
Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here (level2.py) and you'll need the encrypted flag (level2.flag.txt.enc) in the same directory too.

Solve:
Open python script, we can see 
user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
if( user_pw == chr(0x33) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x65) ): -> it is hexadecimal (33396365)
then convert hexadecimal to ASCII, we get 39ce
