Description
Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here(level3.py) and you'll need the encrypted flag (level3.flag.txt.enc) and the hash (level3.hash.bin) in the same directory too.
There are 7 potential passwords with 1 being correct. You can find these by examining the password checker script.

Solve: 
Try every password. or add some codes to do it automatically. Here the code:


flag_enc = open('level3.flag.txt.enc', 'rb').read()
correct_pw_hash = open('level3.hash.bin', 'rb').read()

def hash_pw(pw_str):
# same code

def check_passwords(password_list, correct_hash):
    for password in password_list:
        password_hash = hash_pw(password)
        if password_hash == correct_hash:
            return password  # Return the correct password
    return None  # If no match is found


# The correct password hash and list of possibilities
correct_pw_hash = open('level3.hash.bin', 'rb').read()
pos_pw_list = ["6997", "3ac8", "f0ac", "4b17", "ec27", "4e66", "865e"]

# Check the list of passwords
correct_password = check_passwords(pos_pw_list, correct_pw_hash)

if correct_password:
    print("Correct password found:", correct_password)
else:
    print("No correct password found in the list.")
