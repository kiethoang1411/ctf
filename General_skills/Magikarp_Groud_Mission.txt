Description

Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container, 
`ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `b60940ca`

Solve: 

Click start to launch the ssh picoCTF 
yes to accept the policy then main part: 

$ ls
1of3.flag.txt  instructions-to-2of3.txt

$ cat 1of3.flag.txt
picoCTF{xxsh_

$ cat instructions-to-2of3.txt
Next, go to the root of all things, more succinctly `/`

$ cd / 
$ ls
2of3.flag.txt  dev   instructions-to-3of3.txt  media  proc  sbin  tmp
bin	       etc   lib		       mnt    root  srv   usr
boot	       home  lib64		       opt    run   sys   var

$ cat 2of3.flag.txt
0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_

$ cat instructions-to-3of3.txt
Lastly, ctf-player, go home... more succinctly `~`

$ cd ~
$ ls 
3of3.flag.txt  drop-in

$ cat 3of3.flag.txt
