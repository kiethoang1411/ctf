-> Flag: picoCTF{545h_r1ng1ng_56891419} <- 

Description
Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here (level1.py) and you'll need the encrypted flag (level1.flag.txt.enc) in the same directory too.

Solve
Open level1.py we can see 

user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
if( user_pw == "691d"):
-> run the script and enter 691d
