Description
Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here(level5.py) and you'll need the encrypted flag(level5.flag.txt.enc) and the hash(level5.hash.bin) in the same directory too. 
Here's a dictionary(dictionary.txt) with all possible passwords based on the password conventions we've seen so far.

Solve:
Add some line of codes 

def check_passwords(password_list, correct_hash):
# same codes

# The correct password hash and list of possibilities
correct_pw_hash = open('level5.hash.bin', 'rb').read()

# Read passwords from a text file
with open('dictionary.txt', 'r') as file:
    pos_pw_list = [line.strip() for line in file]

def find_password():
    for user_pw in pos_pw_list:
        user_pw_hash = hash_pw(user_pw)
        
        if user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash:
            print("Correct password found: " + user_pw)
            return
    
    print("No correct password found in the list.")

find_password()
