-> Flag: picoCTF{16_bits_inst34d_of_8_0ddcd97a} <- 

Points: 10

Description
I wonder what this really is... enc(灩捯䍔䙻ㄶ形楴獟楮獴㌴摟潦弸弰摤捤㤷慽) ''.join([chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)])

Solve:
I use hint, so it tells me find some decoders online, so I think about Cyberchef, using magic to detect which encoded with intensive option,
Then I found Encode_text('UTF-16BE (1201)') has the flag
